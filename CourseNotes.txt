I'm using 3.1; his lessons are in 2.1 but things are similar so far.

Adding new items:
Are you know, you can right click, add items.
You can also use CMD. With some package you'll need to download.

"dotnet aspnet-codegenerator"
You need to install it (instructions are on OdeToFood github).
Examples: generate areas, controllers, identities, razorpages, views.
"dotnet aspnet-codegenerator razorpage List Empty -udl -outDir Pages\Restaurants\"
That's just an example of creating a razor page,
naming it, and giving some instructions.
-h for help.

Add a new project.
(You could do anything at all in your code, but creating a new project
both teaches something new and you could re-use the code in another solution.
I wonder how often that actually happens?)
It's a .Net Core Class Library. OdeToFood.Core, for core functions.

Add another project that will provide our data, in lieu of a DB.
Also .Net Core Class Library. OdeToFood.Data.
Add a file type: interface.
